config VFD_SUPPORT
	tristate "7-segment LED display support"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the driver for 7-segment
	  LED displays connected to a LED display driver IC like
	  SM1628, FD628 etc.

	  Communication with the driver IC is done via bit-banging
	  several GPIOs.

	  This driver also optionaly provides input via buttons
	  connected to same IC.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called vfd.

config VFD_NO_KEY_INPUT
	tristate "No key input from IC"
	default n
	depends on VFD_SUPPORT
	help
	  Select this option if you don't have any buttons
	  connected to the driver IC. The driver will not
	  create any input device and save a bit in code size.

config VFD_NO_DELAYS
	tristate "Do not insert delays as per datasheet"
	default n
	depends on VFD_SUPPORT
	help
	  If your CPU isn't blazing fast, calling gpio_xxx functions
	  can be slow enough to make the IC happy without extra delays.
	  This option will remove the delays, which is ok in many cases.

config VFD_PT6964

	help
	  PT6964, SM1628, TM1623, FD268 or FD620 is used to drive the
	  7-segment LED displays
